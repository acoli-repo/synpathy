# Synpathy

Mirror of the Synpathy annotation tool, originally hosted under https://www.mpi.nl/tools/synpathy.html.
The tool has been around for some time, but also has been temporarily unavailable online. The purpose of
this mirror is to a version at hand for whenever MPI hosting policies for legacy software change.
Also, eventual changes can be put here. All initial code and documentation is taken from the original
website and should be attributed accordingly.

We put it under an explicit GPL 3.0 license, originally it used GPL 2.0.
