<h3>February 8, 2007: Release 1.0</h3>
<p>This is the first release of 'synpathy' as a stand-alone tool. It was derived from the Syntax-Viewer of the TIGERSearch project at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.<br>
In order to make the Syntax-Viewer editable, following additions have been made: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li>a more thorough separation of content (annotations) and structure (features).
	</li>
	<li>tooltips for edge labels.
	<li>popup-menus above the nodes (single click) in order to build and manipulate the tree structure.
	</li>
	<li>popup-menus above the nodes (double click) for selecting the content of the nodes/edges.
	</li>
	<li>'read' and 'save' of Features.
	</li>
	<li>possibility to edit all features and to add new terminal node features.
	</li>
	<li>import of terminal nodes from a text file.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
Furthermore quiet some refactoring was performed on the main view components. This was done partly because of an integration of the Syntax-Viewer into 'COREX' (exploration tool for the 'Corpus Spoken Dutch') and partly to make the code more robust, e.g. with respect to empty entries, etc. 
</p>
Possible future extensions may include the features:
<ul>
	<li>Adding and deleting terminal nodes
	</li>
	<li>Making the graphical representation scalable
	</li>
	<li>TeX export
	</li>
	<li>Coupling with ELAN
	</li>
</ul>

<H3>June 14, 2007: Release 1.0.1</H3>
This release contains a bug-fix concerning the deletion of non-terminal nodes.
